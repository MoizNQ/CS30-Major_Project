# Proposal

I am going to be creating a game that will be very similar to stick run. There will be a character that can be controlled using the keys W, S and D. However, I will add several more elements to make the game more fun and interactive. Players will have the option to customize the character. For customizing the character, I will make the shop that will provide players to buy stuff with in-game currency which they can earn by playing the game. 

## Needs to have List

Obstacles:
 * There needs to be some collison obstacles that randomly comes during the run every few meters the character runs. The character will have ability to dodge those obstacles.
Terrain:
 * There will be a terrain running in the background instead of a image to play the game look cooler
Shop and currency:
 * Providing the player to have a shop where they can customize what they want to buy with in-game currency
Sound and effect:
 * Making sure that if character jumps or hit something then theres some noise/sound effect. But also giving the user the ability to close the sound if they want.

## Nice to have List

- Having multiplayer setup would be a great thing
- It would be great if I learn how to make the game go infinitely long but also keeping the possiblity to make it impossible
