# Proposal

I am going to be creating a game that will be very similar to stick run. The gameplay is very simple as the character have to jump and dodge obstacles. The character will be controlled using the keys W or Up arrow.  

## Needs to have List

Character:
 * There will be a character that the user will play with, that will execute all the action needed for the game.

Obstacles:
 * There needs to be some collison obstacles that randomly comes during the run every few meters the character runs. The character will have ability to dodge those obstacles.

Terrain:
 * There will be a terrain running in the background instead of a image to play the game look cooler

Sound and effect:
 * Making sure that if character jumps or hit something then theres some noise/sound effect. But also giving the user the ability to close the sound if they want.

## Nice to have List

- Having multiplayer setup would be a great thing.
- It would be great if I learn how to make the game go infinitely long.
- An ability for users to make their own maps and challenge themselves to complete them on their own.
- Try to keep the items on the body when the player buy the items and want to make the character wear them.
- Would be great if I could add the shop and currency in the game for players to buy stuff.
